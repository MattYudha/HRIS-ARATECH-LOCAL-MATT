- `resources/views/kpi/dashboard.blade.php`
- `resources/views/kpi/show.blade.php`
- `resources/views/kpi/team.blade.php`
- `resources/views/kpi/department.blade.php`
- `resources/views/reports/monthly-recap.blade.php`
- `resources/views/reports/executive-dashboard.blade.php`
- `resources/views/reports/kpi-pdf.blade.php`

## 🔄 Integration Points

### With Existing Modules:
- ✅ Employee Management (employee data)
- ✅ Attendance Module (presence data)
- ✅ Task Management (task completion data)
- ✅ Leave Management (leave utilization)
- ✅ Digital Signature (compliance scoring)
- ✅ Dashboard (add KPI menu items)

### Ready for:
- Dashboard Integration (add KPI widgets)
- Email Notifications (performance alerts)
- Advanced Analytics (trend analysis)
- Integration with HR decisions (promotions, bonuses)

## 📊 KPI Formula Reference

```
Attendance Rate = (Days Present / Working Days) × 100%
Punctuality = (On-time Arrivals / Total Working Days) × 100%
Task Completion = (Completed Tasks / Total Tasks) × 100%
On-time Delivery = (On-time Completed / Total Completed) × 100%
Compliance Score = 100 - (Incidents × 10)
Composite Score = (ATT×0.25 + TASK×0.35 + COMPLIANCE×0.15 + QUALITY×0.15 + CONDUCT×0.10) / 100

Performance Level:
- Excellent: 90-100
- Good: 75-89
- Satisfactory: 60-74
- Needs Improvement: 45-59
- Unsatisfactory: <45
```
